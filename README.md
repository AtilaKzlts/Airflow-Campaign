<div align="center"> <h1>Campaign Performance Tracking</h1> </p> </div>



## Project Introduction
In this project, a dynamic data pipeline supported by a live dashboard was created to enable the marketing department to track the performance of three different campaigns on a monthly basis starting from January 2025. Since the primary goal of the campaigns was promotion, our main metric was ***impressions***, while key performance indicators such as clicks and Cost Per Click (CPC) were also prioritized as key metrics.
