# Campaign Performance Tracking

## Project Introduction
In this project, a data pipeline was created for the marketing department to track the performance of three different campaigns, supported by a live dashboard updated monthly. Since the primary goal of the campaigns is promotion, metrics such as clicks and Cost Per Click (CPC) are prioritized as the key indicators.

This setup allows the marketing team to better analyze the effectiveness of the campaigns, optimize budget usage, and make data-driven decisions to shape future advertising strategies.
