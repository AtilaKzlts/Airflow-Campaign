# Campaign Performance Tracking

## Project Introduction
In this project, a dynamic data pipeline supported by a live dashboard was created to allow the marketing department to monitor the performance of three different campaigns starting from January 2025, on a monthly basis. As the primary objective of the campaigns is promotion, key performance indicators such as the number of clicks and Cost Per Click (CPC) have been prioritized as essential metrics.
